# Cursor Rules

- Work on one feature or bug at a time; test before starting the next.
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages for every change.
- Follow existing code and UI patterns; avoid introducing new libraries unless necessary.
- Break large features into smaller, manageable tasks and commits.
- Update the TODO list as you work; mark tasks as in-progress or complete.
- Write and run tests for all major features and bug fixes.
- Document any new patterns or decisions in code or markdown.
- Refactor files that exceed 200-300 lines; keep code modular.
- Only modify code relevant to the current task; avoid unrelated changes.
- Clean up code before pushing: remove unused code, comments, and debug statements.
